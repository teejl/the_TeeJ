# About TeeJ

## Hello world. 
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

My name is TeeJ. Yes it is a nickname. My parents weren't cool enough to give me a name like TeeJ. Sometimes I like to think I'm the only one in the world that goes by a name like TeeJ. If that was the case then my name's uniqueness would guarantee my awesomeness. 

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in Pure Mathematics. I like to think of myself as a mathematician just as all the old geezers did. However my contribution as a mathematician isn't like theirs. They directly contributed by writing papers, while I am simply a soldier on the front lines. I swing away at problems in front of me with my calculator. I am just an average citizen trying to get by. I guess some can say "average" is very subjective. Nonetheless, I love solving problems in anyway I can. When you break everything down that is who I am a Problem Solver. 

## Patience is a Virtue
"Open up your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you are living?" Bob Marley

Patience is a good thing to have. Too bad I tend to lose my patience all the time. I get in a rush. Some might say I'm like an energizer bunny marching on the front lines. Beat by beat I never quit. If I have to slow down I never stop moving, and instead I'd rather go in circles. It is nice to have faith that no matter where we are as people that we have faith that we will be where we want to be. That and everything is going to be okay. Bob Marley was on to something.  

## Off the Bridge
"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

If you read this take a risk today. Or else.

I'm not going to lie taking a risk is tough. It is like jumping off a bridge. It builds up into that moment until you jump. Thinking too long can force you to back down. Poor execution can make you look like a fool. However the more we fail the more we learn. It is simple physics. 

## Financial Calories
"Don't look forward, don't look backwards."

I was thinking today that it would be a strange society if we had to buy calories. Now this might not make any sense at first, but what I mean is that in order to purchase food you pay in calorie tickets. Then calorie tickets could be purchased by a 3rd source, namely a government. It would help regulate health in a society. For example, if someone wanted to buy a 100 calorie bag of chips they would have to use equivalent of 100 calorie tickets. Also if this fantasy did exist one could be awarded calorie tickets for working out or perhaps some other activities.

## Happiness
"Be so good they can't ignore you." Steve Martin

A lot of the time I forget to be happy. It sounds silly, but it is the truth. Sometimes happiness is tough to find, since its not a tangeable thing. However, sometimes it is just that easy. I find that when I use the 5 senses, I am blessed to have as a human to have, I find myself obtainig happiness easier. I challenge you to try it whenever you are feeling down. Really observe something, feel something, smell something, or listen to nature take its course. In the end our opinion is the only one that matters about ourselves, and we are in control of our own happiness.

## Breathless
"In the end, it's not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away."

After I graduated from my undergraduate degree I was a little bummed out. I was bummed out becuase I wouldn't be apart of a university. I would no longer have access to the many resources for free. No more study groups, cute ladies, and old geezers. No more knockin back beers and watching jeopardy with my roommate. Without this what else is left?

Turns out it isn't the end. It never is. Even though I might be moving on to another phase of my life it doesn't mean I have to change who I am. I still can learn. I still can do all of those things I did before. I can do them better than before. In the end we can't let the chaos of our life's change let us lose the best part of us. 

Also when we move on we have to accept that it is the best for us. That we are choosing to do it. We are in control of our choas, not the other way around.

## I Spy
"Live in the now."

The detail it has is unexplainable. The longer I look the more I understand it. Completely random, but true. It is not false, for if it was I could not see it. Flat. Brown. Smooth. It feels soft, or is it my fingers. Sliding my fingers over it makes no sense. What it looks like makes no sense. Why do I have this object in front of me? Why am I able to even feel or see this objects? Who cares. I can. I am more powerful since I can. And for a moment nothing mattered.

## Genius
"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life beliving it is stupid."

Would you rather live your whole life feeling you are stupid, but actually be a "genius" in whatever you do. Or would you rather feel like a genius, but actually be "stupid" in whatever you do. I coin the words "genius" and "stupid" since they are subjective.

To truely grow we must feel uncomfortable. To be smart we must feel dumb. To be strong we must feel weak. And what comes after the struggle is up to us. 

## Ugly Truth
"Nature is pleased with simplicity."

The idea of a good picture to some people is a smile with a good outfit. But what does this picture tell? The truth isn't always smiles and nice outfits. Is the truth really so bad? Plus there is something creepy about smiles. The best picture is the one of reality. The one that tells a story. Capturing the true moment.

## Rough Patch
"When everything goes wrong, that's when adventure starts."

I'm not the best with relationships. I find myself in similar shoes alot of the times. Despite my happiness, I can't seem to help the other person find their happiness. It beats me up inside becuase life is meaningless without happiness.

I often find myself in relationships where the other person is unhappy. I feel selfish for being happy whenever it happens. A wise man told me that a question to ask every relationship is "are you happier together, or seperate?" a good rule of thumb to live by. Is it the case where I would be happier with her, and she would be happier alone? I think it comes down to my investment into the relationship. I think when one person invests more time into the relationship than another person it can become stressful for them. They feel forgotten. In order to truly love someone, one must want the loved one to be happy.

## Reach Further
"Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll settle among the stars."

Every once in a while we sell ourself short. Yes it sucks. I made a motto to keep rising. I have stayed true to that motto, and I feel I'm on the right path now. The path to the top of the ladder, nay to the next step of the ladder. When I reach the top I won't exactly know. Perhaps there is no top. Regardless I'm here to find out. I must push further. 

## Missing Belt
"Excuses are the bricks that build a house of failure."

I lost my belt today. It was like family. I have no idea where he could be. He was such a nice belt too. He couln't have ran away, no that's not his personality. He was loyal, always there whenever I needed him. Now I am without him. No more perfect size pants. No more rushing to restroom and barely making it. No more spanking for my little brother. Life is just not the same. Belt, where ever you might be out there, just know I am coming for you.  

## Something 

Sometimes its nice to do nothing.

## Addictions
"One step at a time. One hour at a time. One day at a time."

I'm finding out I'm addicted to math. While on the other hand one of my relatives is also struggling with an addiction. He has chosen to go into rehab to become a better person. I'm finding out addictions are a very strange thing. 

I understand the ambition to feel good, but it is surprising on the things people will do to feel good. I guess what stops me from following the same path is 1) I don't have a source 2) I don't want to be dependent on objects. 

Happiness goes hand in hand with unhappiness. I understand that a person cannot feel optimum happiness without felling some unhappiness. However, I do beleive a person can coast their happiness. By this I mean having a close to average amount of happiness throughout the whole day. Overall I think the ladder yeilds more happiness, and this is my reasoning: Any unhappiness can corrupt all of the happiness no matter how strong. In fact, the stronger the happiness I think makes the unhappiness even worse since they are being take away from it. For example, it is much more enjoyable to jog a mile than walk and sprint in the same amount of time.

I mainly coast my happiness with Basketball, Mathematics, and Friends.  

## Shiny Object Syndrome
"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'

I have been chasing too many dreams. I need to cut the excess out of my life and make it simple once more. A simple life is easy and enjoyable. I want to be a Data Scienties. I want to be a Student, a teacher, an actuary, a mathematician, a boyfriend, and a basketball player. No TeeJ you can't do all of these things and be happy/successful at all of them. So instead I have cut them out. Or most of them and I am left with being a boyfriend, an actuary/mathematician, and a guy trying to enjoy his activities/friends. My priorities are aligned. My schedule is flexible. My life is relaxed. 

## Attraction
"You create your thoughts, your thoughts create your intentions, and your intentions create your reality." 

I find the art of attraction quite strange. It is weird that we as people are attracted to one another, and actually unattracted to one another. It is something that is unexplainable. For instance, take a girl you have a crush on or your girlfriend. The first time you saw that person it was like... wow. For some reason they have something appealing. Something that causes you to not look away. Something that pulls in all of your attention. And in the end it is all subjective.

## Upward Expectation
"The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going."

Having a plan and sticking to it can be the hardest part to succeed. It is why Hitler was able to accomplish what he did. Although cruel he did big things. It is possibly the reason why Trump was able to become president and possibly do what he said he was going to do. It makes me fear what could happen in the future. Trump is trying to build a wall, cut off free trade, and take away health care. What is this man trying to accomplish? Where does he see us in five years? The world is making way for him regardless of what happens. I fear that what he is doing is going to change the world in a negative way. Similar to losing a finger. Before we choose which finger, let's grab some popcorn and watch what happens next.

## The Light

I'm looking at a peice of paper with the sun's rays shining on it. But not a straight glare more of an ocean of light. It is moving from left to right. Its path is as unpredictable as its beauty. Just free to go where it pleases. Constantly moving, stopping for nobody. 

## My Bladder

I am not sure if I have already mentioned how small my bladder is. It is ridiculous. I literally have to go to the restroom 3 times per hour some days. There actually was a time that I had to go back to the rest room while walking back from the rest room. Maybe there is something wrong with it. Nah I doubt it, I'm awesome.

## Flashing Red and Blue
"Life is not a matter of having a good hand, but playing a poor hand well."

Today I was driving to work and of course a cop puts on his lights behind me. The first thing that went through my mind was who is he going to pull over now? I have always heard he picks on the weakest link, so I wasn't about to pull over to the right lane where he was driving. That would be like taking a bullet for a stranger I don't know. A stranger who thought his outdated hunk o metal was faster than my sweet slick speedster. Instead I stayed in my lane away from the cop, and he passed me. Sometimes the game is all about confidence. Today I won. 

## Stand Up
"If you do not stand for something, you will fall for anything."

I realize that I need to stand up for what I love doing. I need to live for my passion. To be more clear I need to find the thing that I  am willing to give up short term pleasure over. One thing I find short term pleasure in is video games. I always love playing video games/ puzzles. It is who I am since I am a mathematician. However there has only been one thing I have had the ambition to give up video games for: learning math. I love to learn math and I need to follow my passion. When I retire I hope I never lose my passion to learn math without replacing it by something else that is just as awesome. 

## Webpage
"Work hard dream big."

I have been brainstorming about remaking my GitHub. It would be nice to try to create my own website. If I were to create this hypothetical website I would have to have a homepage and side tabs. I think I would format it into the following tabs:
Homepage (the_TeeJ) the about me.
The side tabs would be labeled respectively (the_Mathematician, the_Programmer, the_Books, and other ideas I think of).
Some other ideas I have thought about including are statistics, however I have not developed the statistic skills to fully develop my own tab. In the programmig tab I want to complete SPOJ problems while the mathematician tabs I can write the answers to the mathematic books I read. This is just a work in progress and I want to use GitHub until I decide whether to build this website or not. 

## Redefined
"Leadership isn't about being great, it is about enabling others to be great." 

Who are you? It is a question that is hard to answer. I am human. Yes, a hard question to answer. How we define ourself is how we carry ourself. I like to think somedays that I am a computer programmer. Somedays a mathematician. Others a goof. However nothing really defines me. So how does one classify who they are in one sentence: you make your own definition. So I conclude with my answer to this question. Who are you? I AM TEEJ! An answer so simple, yet so complex. In a professional sense it is a lack of information. In a casual experience it is a lack of experience. Instead this is an answer that one has to obtain their own view, since it is I who will never be able to tell you who I am or what I will mean to you in the future. But I can tell you I AM TEEJ!

## Slow Down
"The hardest part sometimes is waiting"

Moments come and go. I can be impatient at times. Actually alot. Life now is different from being out of school. In school I was able to recieve constant feedback, and take multiple courses at once. In a way I was able to feel like I was capable of doing everyting and work my own schedule. However outside of school the choices I make I must be twice as patient with. I receive less feedback, I am not as in control of my own schedule, and I am capable of doing few objectives outside of work. It makes me feel indecisive. If I choose math I won't be able to program. If I program I won't be able to do finance. If I do this I won't... In reality I just need to relax. I need to take one step at a time, and trust that the decision I have made will pay off. The hardest part sometimes is waiting.

## Dream On
"Beleive in your dreams. They were given to you for a reason." by Katrina Mayer

For once I can see my future clearly. I see my new apartment and my potentially new job. Now what job exactly I won't be able to mention, however I can tell you that I will continue to have the "AHA!" moments I had in college while carrying myself in a professional manner. Now for my new apartment it is awesome. Tidy and fancy. Quality over quantity. A minimalist's apartment. It is nice to have this picture in my mind where I am headed. It makes moving forward exciting and easy. It is what I have read can be viewed as a mental model. I hear that mental models help execution through productivity and accuracy. The catch is things never go according to planned. They usually haven't in the past, and I doubt it will be like that in the future. Nonetheless it is nice to dream. While dreams change, actions resonate permenantly. 

## Less is More
"Talk less, say more."

One of my buddies in college, a great guy, introduced me to writing. At first I was offput. All the writing classes I had taken in the past I didn't enjoy very much, and I wasn't the best at grammer (I know its grammar). Until he mentioned something that I would never forget. He said writing long stories isn't that interesting, but being able to say what you want to say with just one sentence or sometimes less now that is interesting. Then it hit me that is it. I didn't like writing because I always dreaded the parameters. In the past the teachers would always stressed that the paper needed to be x amount of pages in legnth. The format had to be exact. Doesn't this take away from english? English is about creativity. It is about expressing the same idea in completely different ways. It is about goblins trying to take out a bunch of dwarves in a tree (for those Hobbit fans). Nonetheless, Less is more. Less is more when it is higher quality. And in my opinion more is less and takes away from the quality of the rest. For example, go to a buffet and eat everything you can find. The food you thought was your favorite makes you cringe and tastes terrible on a full stomach. However on an empty stomach it gives you feelings that warms your blood.

## Falling Up
"Success is a journey not a destination." 

It is insane how a person's life can change overnight for the better or the worse. For me my life has changed overnight. I was struggling to be able to do big things and make a difference in the world. Finding a purpose so to say. Minutes before finding my purpose I doubted myself. I felt powerless. And no longer than an hour later my world completely changed. I don't believe in sudden change, but I do believe in checkpoints. Whenever a person does something great, and keeps doing something great eventually he will aquire what one might call success. Nonethelss I am excited for my new journey. I am excited to take the new path I doubted could exist.

## Let Them Know
"My mind is telling me no, but my body my body is telling me yes."
A song somewhere in the world.

I am going to admit it I have failed. I have failed at letting the world know who I am and how I feel about things. Now this might sound crazy to hear becuase alot of the time nobody cares to hear others opinions. At the end of the day they are irrelevant. However whenever it is someone close, then it is much different. With someone close we share feeling, moments, and stress. I have failed on my close friends and girlfriend because I can't speak up on how I feel about things. To be honest I didn't completely fail on my friend. It felt so wierd because I called him out. I felt so nervous, but through the end we became closer. Conflict sometimes puts two people on the same page. It is like a bump in the road. It might make a big noise, but once the noise is over everything is back to normal. Most of the time better.

Where I really failed was whenever I wasn't straight forward about my feelings. Whenever I am not straight forward about my feelings I tend to change my mind last minute. But now that it has been done how can I prevent things like this from happening again? Speak up? Write more? It gets very confusing. I wish I had the wisdom to these problems. Perhaps I'll master them through parenthood. 

## Axioms of Professionalism

Hello,

I would like to write to you the axioms of professionalism. The rules to follow in the workplace. 
Let me start:

1. Do not say anything negative.
  People do not have time for negativity. It is unproductive.
  
2. Do not do the same task twice without becoming better.
  Each task should be a project. A way to make it quicker. A way to learn more.

3. Learn from others.
  Everyone is a genius. Find out how.
  
4. Respond ASAP.
  As soon as you receive a message take care of it. People are the number one asset.
  
5. Reread and Rewrite.
  Nothing is completely finished. It can always be documented better. (More organized, quicker, more efficient)
  
6. Be better than your supervisor.
  Create a legacy. A long line of brilliance.
  
7. Nothing is a final draft unless it is 100% accuracy.
  A final draft is perfect. Needs to be perfect.
  
Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I hope I did not forget to include any other axioms. 

Sincerely,
TJL

## Financially Responsible

I would like to take a second to bring up financial responsibility. I assume that most people try to live within their means. However a lot of us want to be able to live above our means. To be able to do anything we want no matter how ridiculous it is. In order to do this we have to be financially responsible. We have to use our money for the important things in life. If you try to buy everything surely you will go broke. It is like choosing your friends. You can only spend your time with so many people. 

Time is another resource we must be aware of. Time and money are the decisions we make that enable us to become ourselves. It is just because how the economy works. I mean surely you can get away without money, but the lifestyle is not one I want to talk about. Also I would like to mention that I am not talking about a lifestyle with an overabundance of money either. Just the average Joe. I guess even that is ambigious. Rich and poor are relative to the person. 

Nevertheless, we need to harvest our time and money to maintain an adventure. It is like coasting. Sailing if you will. Don't lean too much to one side or the other. That doesn't mean don't lean at all. The direction is the one of your choosing. But just don't tip over. Becuase once you get wet you can't get unwet. Now what does it mean to get wet? It means to spend the money you don't have. Don't spend the money you don't have unless it is leverage for a great opportunity. By this I mean student loans are good and car loans/ mortgages are bad. 

At the same time you should be the bank. Don't expect that banks are the only ones who can give out loans. Bonds and stocks and what not are esentially the citizen's form of giving business loans. But be careful. 

Mathematically speaking you can get a loan for $10. Let us say that you will owe $10.30 at the end of the year. Then you can buy a $10 hat for $10.30. Not to mention to make that $10 you were taxed by the government from your income that you made from your job and once again for the purchase. That or you can invest your $10 for $10.30 at the end of the year, and realize that you have more money to invest next year and didn't have to spend the $10. It might not seem like a lot, but once we build a great chunk it will grow so fast that we can live off of it. For example, let us say we ended up with $10,000. In the same scenario we could buy a $10,000 car for $10,300 orrrr we could have $300 extra dollars to save next year. Staying at 3% interest how much would we need to save to make $20,000 a year? About $666,666.67. Hmmmm that isn't so bad... So the goal is to keep the stash growing!! 

Now this might sound crazy, but what if you children could not withdraw the money. Instead that received the income. It wouldn't take too long to double the money. In fact if the child received it whenever they were born they could probably double it by 18. So the legacy could keep going, and then would your family ever have to work again? I guess it depends on how you live.

## Fork in the Road

It seems that as I go through my daily routine I crave something more. More adventure, more risk, more heartbeats. Most of the lack of excitement is coming from the fact that I live in a city with the median age 7 years older than I am. I am in a place where people raise children and retire. I'm sure if you took the variance of the ages it would be very high. This is the opposite of what I desire from a city. From a place I call home.

It is terrible because I love my job. I love my team. Some of the greatest people I have been surrounded by, and I am blessed to be able to learn from them. I have noticed I am coming close to the 2 years of experience mark. This is a huge opportunity for me to move to a city where the variance of the age is lower and the median age is closer to mine. I know this sounds a little insane to judge a city based on the age of the people. Age is just a number. But it does make a difference.

I have had a down to earth conversation with my girlfriend multiple times, and we want to take the next step by going to an exciting city. We have our eye on a few great locations: Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, Austin, and New York City. I have no idea what is next for me. I am excited though. I can't wait to take the next leap. To raise my heart rate. To find more risk. To have an adventure.

As we live life we can continue to make the "safe" choices and be in a very comfortable situation. However too much comfort neglects the challenges we face as people. The challenges that cause us to grow and dream.
