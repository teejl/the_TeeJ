# About TeeJ

## Hello world. 
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

My name is TeeJ. Yes it is a nickname. My parents weren't cool enough to give me a name like TeeJ. Sometimes I like to think I'm the only one in the world that goes by a name like TeeJ. If that was the case then my name's uniqueness would guarantee my awesomeness. 

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in Pure Mathematics. I like to think of myself as a mathematician just as all the old geezers did. However my contribution as a mathematician isn't like theirs. They directly contributed by writing papers, while I am simply a soldier on the front lines. I swing away at problems in front of me with my calculator. I am just an average citizen trying to get by. I guess some can say "average" is very subjective. Nonetheless, I love solving problems in anyway I can. When you break everything down that is who I am a Problem Solver. 

## Patience is a Virtue
"Open up your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you are living?" Bob Marley

Patience is a good thing to have. Too bad I tend to lose my patience all the time. I get in a rush. Some might say I'm like an energizer bunny marching on the front lines. Beat by beat I never quit. If I have to slow down I never stop moving, and instead I'd rather go in circles. It is nice to have faith that no matter where we are as people that we have faith that we will be where we want to be. That and everything is going to be okay. Bob Marley was on to something.  

## Off the Bridge
"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

If you read this take a risk today. Or else.

I'm not going to lie taking a risk is tough. It is like jumping off a bridge. It builds up into that moment until you jump. Thinking too long can force you to back down. Poor execution can make you look like a fool. However the more we fail the more we learn. It is simple physics. 

## Financial Calories
"Don't look forward, don't look backwards."

I was thinking today that it would be a strange society if we had to buy calories. Now this might not make any sense at first, but what I mean is that in order to purchase food you pay in calorie tickets. Then calorie tickets could be purchased by a 3rd source, namely a government. It would help regulate health in a society. For example, if someone wanted to buy a 100 calorie bag of chips they would have to use equivalent of 100 calorie tickets. Also if this fantasy did exist one could be awarded calorie tickets for working out or perhaps some other activities.

## Happiness
"Be so good they can't ignore you." Steve Martin

A lot of the time I forget to be happy. It sounds silly, but it is the truth. Sometimes happiness is tough to find, since its not a tangeable thing. However, sometimes it is just that easy. I find that when I use the 5 senses, I am blessed to have as a human to have, I find myself obtainig happiness easier. I challenge you to try it whenever you are feeling down. Really observe something, feel something, smell something, or listen to nature take its course. In the end our opinion is the only one that matters about ourselves, and we are in control of our own happiness.

## Breathless
"In the end, it's not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away."

After I graduated from my undergraduate degree I was a little bummed out. I was bummed out becuase I wouldn't be apart of a university. I would no longer have access to the many resources for free. No more study groups, cute ladies, and old geezers. No more knockin back beers and watching jeopardy with my roommate. Without this what else is left?

Turns out it isn't the end. It never is. Even though I might be moving on to another phase of my life it doesn't mean I have to change who I am. I still can learn. I still can do all of those things I did before. I can do them better than before. In the end we can't let the chaos of our life's change let us lose the best part of us. 

Also when we move on we have to accept that it is the best for us. That we are choosing to do it. We are in control of our choas, not the other way around.

## I Spy
"Live in the now."

The detail it has is unexplainable. The longer I look the more I understand it. Completely random, but true. It is not false, for if it was I could not see it. Flat. Brown. Smooth. It feels soft, or is it my fingers. Sliding my fingers over it makes no sense. What it looks like makes no sense. Why do I have this object in front of me? Why am I able to even feel or see this objects? Who cares. I can. I am more powerful since I can. And for a moment nothing mattered.

## Genius
"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life beliving it is stupid."

Would you rather live your whole life feeling you are stupid, but actually be a "genius" in whatever you do. Or would you rather feel like a genius, but actually be "stupid" in whatever you do. I coin the words "genius" and "stupid" since they are subjective.

To truely grow we must feel uncomfortable. To be smart we must feel dumb. To be strong we must feel weak. And what comes after the struggle is up to us. 

## Ugly Truth
"Nature is pleased with simplicity."

The idea of a good picture to some people is a smile with a good outfit. But what does this picture tell? The truth isn't always smiles and nice outfits. Is the truth really so bad? Plus there is something creepy about smiles. The best picture is the one of reality. The one that tells a story. Capturing the true moment.

## Rough Patch
"When everything goes wrong, that's when adventure starts."

I'm not the best with relationships. I find myself in similar shoes alot of the times. Despite my happiness, I can't seem to help the other person find their happiness. It beats me up inside becuase life is meaningless without happiness.

I often find myself in relationships where the other person is unhappy. I feel selfish for being happy whenever it happens. A wise man told me that a question to ask every relationship is "are you happier together, or seperate?" a good rule of thumb to live by. Is it the case where I would be happier with her, and she would be happier alone? I think it comes down to my investment into the relationship. I think when one person invests more time into the relationship than another person it can become stressful for them. They feel forgotten. In order to truly love someone, one must want the loved one to be happy.

## Reach Further
"Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll settle among the stars."

Every once in a while we sell ourself short. Yes it sucks. I made a motto to keep rising. I have stayed true to that motto, and I feel I'm on the right path now. The path to the top of the ladder, nay to the next step of the ladder. When I reach the top I won't exactly know. Perhaps there is no top. Regardless I'm here to find out. I must push further. 

## Missing Belt
"Excuses are the bricks that build a house of failure."

I lost my belt today. It was like family. I have no idea where he could be. He was such a nice belt too. He couln't have ran away, no that's not his personality. He was loyal, always there whenever I needed him. Now I am without him. No more perfect size pants. No more rushing to restroom and barely making it. No more spanking for my little brother. Life is just not the same. Belt, where ever you might be out there, just know I am coming for you.  

## Something 

Sometimes its nice to do nothing.

## Addictions
"One step at a time. One hour at a time. One day at a time."

I'm finding out I'm addicted to math. While on the other hand one of my relatives is also struggling with an addiction. He has chosen to go into rehab to become a better person. I'm finding out addictions are a very strange thing. 

I understand the ambition to feel good, but it is surprising on the things people will do to feel good. I guess what stops me from following the same path is 1) I don't have a source 2) I don't want to be dependent on objects. 

Happiness goes hand in hand with unhappiness. I understand that a person cannot feel optimum happiness without felling some unhappiness. However, I do beleive a person can coast their happiness. By this I mean having a close to average amount of happiness throughout the whole day. Overall I think the ladder yeilds more happiness, and this is my reasoning: Any unhappiness can corrupt all of the happiness no matter how strong. In fact, the stronger the happiness I think makes the unhappiness even worse since they are being take away from it. For example, it is much more enjoyable to jog a mile than walk and sprint in the same amount of time.

I mainly coast my happiness with Basketball, Mathematics, and Friends.  

## Shiny Object Syndrome
"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'

I have been chasing too many dreams. I need to cut the excess out of my life and make it simple once more. A simple life is easy and enjoyable. I want to be a Data Scienties. I want to be a Student, a teacher, an actuary, a mathematician, a boyfriend, and a basketball player. No TeeJ you can't do all of these things and be happy/successful at all of them. So instead I have cut them out. Or most of them and I am left with being a boyfriend, an actuary/mathematician, and a guy trying to enjoy his activities/friends. My priorities are aligned. My schedule is flexible. My life is relaxed.
